The fundamental goal of the CodeHelp Project is to provide students and even the teachers to access the application and help each others code. Coding is definitely not easy for everyone since it is something that is developing everyday and even professionals have things to learn everyday. This application can simply
help out many students to code by easily asking inside the platform and potentially getting answers from people who knows the answer which provides teamwork and ethic work. 

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
