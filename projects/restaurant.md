KG Japanese Food is a demonstration website that allows users to see what it will look like if a Japanese Food Restaurant had a website that consisted of about, menu, and survey page. 
Each page is uniquely designed to make it stand out but keeping it simple so that it makes it easier for the user's to read. The About page is all about introducing the Business and talking about history. 
The Menu page has every food that can be ordered throughout the business which also includes appetizers and main dishes. Lastly, The Survey page is all about the response from the user's if any changes has to be made.
