Financial Education should be encouraged to learn among young children so that they have more opportunities to be financially successful. Education is very important amongs young people so that they can use what they have learned towards their future goals but learning finance is as important for future education. One most  important thing that children must learn before becoming an adult is learning finance. Financial education is basically the study of financial awareness, financial self-knowledge, attitude, and behaviour which helps to learn about how money works (Németh et al., 2020). However, not every school or even parents at home are teaching these skills but considering being very important for each individuals, it should be encouraged to take financial literacy to help young adults in the future. 
The main reason why I thought financial education should be required for education is because of my own experience. Whenever I moved to Wyoming few years ago, the school allowed me to take financial class which really helped me to learn how important to have educations on finance. Also, my teacher for the financial class was talking about how much impact he has made with his finance after taking financial class which led him to understand how successful taking finance class can be. According to the source,  “a longitudinal study reported that adults who had taken a personal finance course in high school saved a greater proportion of their income when they were older” (Walstad et al., 2010, p. 338). I personally gained many important things from taking financial literacy which even helped me budget and also get tax feeback due to the state law. I was fascinated by the idea that it even talks about laws in depth while talking about how finance comes in play. 
The important aspect of taking financial education when people are young is that it allows people to learn how to budget. Although United States is one of the wealthiest country, currently there are many people who is not even sure on how to save up money on the best potential and losing out on so much money when they have so many opportunities to use it for (Faulkner, 2022). For example, people talks about being able to calculate taxes and expenses are very important but not that many people actually knows exactly how to calculate them which could lead to inaccurate budget. Having an inaccurate budgeting is a very negative aspect with finance because it causes individuals to needing to spend less and even save more to stay attached to financial goals. 
Children learning financial education doesn’t only help with saving up money but it also helps to invest the money to get to the financial goal sooner. Investing is risking the money towards something to earn more profits. For example, people can simply invest their money into small amounts of stocks and later on sell it for higher profits which allows people to earn more money. Financial literacy has proved that people that took that class has higher chance of better decision making when investing and even stock pricing efficiency (Yin & Yang, 2022). Financial education many times teach individuals on how to invest the money usually by using simulators which makes it easier for students to understand. Students are not only taught on how to invest but also on what to invest in like stocks, real estate, mutual funds, and etc. 
During childhood, many people constantly faces with decisions on whether to buy something thay they want or need which financial education can help with. Financial literacy will educate students on consequences of spending on something that is needed vs wants which helps students to develop habits to spend and budget wisely. The earlier the people starts to get in the habit of choosing wise decisions, the easier to for each individuals to learn the needs and wants and budget more accordingly. Because there are many people who does not have the habits of choosing to spend on the needs and wants, most people are losing on so much potential with budgeting. 
One great features for having great financial decision is the idea to always prepare for an emergencies. Many people don’t even have saving accounts to prepare for emergencies and it is important to always have separate money for emergencies. Since emergencies has a chance of happening any time, children learning to make good financial decisions can really make their life better. Money is not that easy to get when needing to have a lot of money in a short period of times and taking financial class can prepare each individuals to worry and prepare for a emergency. 
Many people fear having any sorts of debt because debt can many times cause even more debt. However, not everyone is capable of avoiding to get some sort of loans because there are some important things in life that can cost a lot of money including house and cars. Financial literacy will teach people on how to prepare for when it comes to debt and how to be financially free in the future. Financial literacy can also teach people on how to reduce the debt amount by choosing wise decisions. For example, comparing different colleges and the average student loans which students can choose in order to find college that is more affordable. 
Staying out of debt or learning about debt allows people to increase credit scores. Many people might think that going in debt and paying it back is a very wrong decisions to make. However, having good credit scores actually has many benefits including money back, better housing options, and lower interest rates. Financial literacy talks about how impactful to have debt but also teaches on how to use it well to keep a good credit score. According to the source, “Your credit report is important because lenders, insurers, employers and others may obtain your credit report from credit bureaus to assess how you manage financial responsibilities” (Carmona, 2012, p. 12).   Learning about credit scores can actually benefit many students to stay on track and keep the scores because once the credit score is bad it is very hard to get it back up to the good score which financial education can teach on how to stay on track. 
There are many people that talks about trying to retire, however, not knowing about debt or loan can really delay the retirement age. Depending on the debt amount, it can even cause a person to never retire in a worse case. The great aspect about learning about debt or loan is that it allows people to not just avoid but also handle the situations with debt because handling debt wrong can cause even more debt which is widely known as infinite debt trap. Retiring for some people like young student’s can think that retiring is a very long way, however, learning how to use money well can make each individuals retirement age sooner and that can be learned through financial education.
The great thing about taking financial course in school is that it allows people to prepare for adulthood meaning that each individuals can gain confidence towards finance. Many people struggle and stress whether or not if they are going to be good at using money. Financial education has provened that it allows people to have more confidence towards finance and increased health literacy (Handy et al., 2021). Taking financial literacy will teach individuals on how to handle money which will lead they to not stress over finance in the future and instead have confidence handling money. 
Financial education can be very helpful to gain social skills. Since financial education requires learning about finance, it also teaches social skills by talking to others. Financial education does not teach people on just how to manage money well but to create social skills to build up opportunities to make more money. Without any social skills, it is almost impossible for each person to gain the ability to stay on task with their finance. Many times financial educations require presentations and many group activities to build up these skills that can be utilized in the future. 
Financial literacy allows people to look into jobs realistically and compare finance. Although finance is not the only factor that determines if certain jobs are great, but it talks about how much individual jobs make for educational purposes. Because financial education looks at actual salaries for each jobs, people can really look into if certain jobs are actually the great choice for each individual. It is true that each individuals should follow their own dream jobs, however, finance is also a very important aspects and students need to think more realistically than just following what they want. 
In conclusion, I believe that financial education is very important for young people to take during childhood because it allows people to be more financially stable in the future. If young children learn the habits of having great financial behaviors early, then it has a higher chance that each individuals has better choices in future. Currently, there are many people who has bad habits with finance and the earlier it is for people to learn good habits, the more efficient they can be with finance.
