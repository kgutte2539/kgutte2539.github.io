One of the hardest things to learn in life is learning a new language and there are so many people who gave up learning a new language due to it's difficulty. The best way to learn a new language is not to just read and study, however, it is important to visit the country that speaks that language. Although it is very important to at least know the basics
like alphabets and simple things, it would be hard to master the accent and the fluency until you visit the country. Visiting the country that speaks the language that you are trying to learn can easily help you with developing the language because you are in a forced environment to speak that language. It is true that when people are put into 
unknown environment, human body tries to adapt to it and this also occurs to when learning a new language at a different country.
